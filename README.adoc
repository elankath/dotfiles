= dotfiles

My new dotfiles that leverages the non-VIM portions of yadr dotfiles. The ZSH and other configurations of YADR https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles are great. The VIM portions are too heavyweight and most un-forgivably YARD hardcodes the leader key to ',' explicitly in all its keybindings  which makes it a noogo for me. I use SPACE as the leader key.
