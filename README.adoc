= dotfiles

My new dotfiles that leverages the non-VIM portions of yadr dotfiles. The ZSH and other configurations of YADR https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles are great. The VIM portions are too heavyweight and most un-forgivably YARD hardcodes the leader key to ',' explicitly in all its keybindings  which makes it a noogo for me. I use SPACE as the leader key. 

== Setup
* Install YADR with the following command.
----
sh -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skwp/dotfiles/master/install.sh`" -s ask
----
* Then link ~/.zsh.after to dotfiles/zsh-after



== YADR ZSH  customizations
