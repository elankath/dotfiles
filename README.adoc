== Overview

My new cross-platform dotfiles (works on MacOS/Windows) that configures ZSH and VIM. It
leverages prezto for ZSH configuration. 
 
== Pre-Requisites: Needs Manual Setup 
=== Windows
- Install link:https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey], the fantastic windows package manager for software.
- If you are on Windows 10 with at-least the Creators Update please install the https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl["Windows Subsystem for Linux"] which is also called by the terrible name of "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows". Refer to the https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide[Installation Guide]. 
- IF you are on an older build of Windows,  install link:Cygwin[http://cygwin.com/]. Cygwin Support will be dropped in the future as Cygwin is slow as hell.
 ** Cygwin: Make sure you install the following cygwin components are selected for installation: `zsh`,`wget`,`curl`.
 ** Cygwin: Change Home Directory to Windows Home Directory. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1494658/how-can-i-change-my-cygwin-home-folder-after-installation. You need to basically add a line `db_home:  /%H` to `/etc/nsswitch.conf`.
 ** Cygwin: Change Shell to ZSH. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22363210/set-default-shell-in-cygwin/37815158#37815158. You need to add/edit the line containing `db_shell`.
 ** Cygwin: Install apt-cyg. See https://github.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg
